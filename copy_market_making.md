My copy market maker and live-testing capabilities will be here.

The idea is simple. Look for other people in the market who are placing orders with really large sizings, and undercut them. Based off a lot of analysis, the prices in the market posted by these people don't appear to be immiedietly exploitable. Sometimes they even exhibit incredibly large spreads, upwards of 20c especially when getting really close to expiry (<10m).
